Groups of voters vote for the most favorable option for themselves in a simple economic model. Turnout is based on the group's difference in welfare. The tax implemented, and therefore the welfare results, can change depending on the voting system. We also check the Condorcet Winner and Loser, two criteria used for evaluating voting systems. This illustrates how neither voting system meets the Condorcet Winner criterion, but instant runoff meets the Condorcet Loser criterion.
